/*  question :
constraints : M ,N > 0

input format :
the first line of input contains the length M of the first array A1
the second line of input contains the length N of the second array A2
the third line of input contains M elements of A1 seperated by a single white line
the fourth line of input contains N elements of A2 seperated by a single white line

output format :
a single line of output contains Z, in which the element sequence of both arrays is seperated by a comma
and a single white space and is put in a square bracket as per the simple output

sample input :
6
5
1 2 3 4 5 6
6 7 8 5 9

sample output : [1, 6, 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 5, 5, 9, 6]

explanation :

from the sample input , given A1 of size is 6 and A2 of size is 5
the output is the combined array that has elements of the first array followed by elements of the second array
hence we got 1, 6, 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 5, 5, 9  followed by the remaining element in the first array 6.
hence we get the output as [1, 6, 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 5, 5, 9, 6]
